# SafeMe Project
SafeMe application is an mobile application that will help the users to notify other users within a certain distance of danger in order to minimize casualty. This mobile application will alert nearby mobile devices by sending a detailed profile of the user and the danger that they are facing. Not only can the mobile application alert nearby devices but also it can receive notification from other devices. When a user creates a detailed profile, the user should be able to send and receive alerts with least amount of effort as possible.


This project is to allow users to alert others, who also have the app, in emergency situations within a 20 miles radius.
